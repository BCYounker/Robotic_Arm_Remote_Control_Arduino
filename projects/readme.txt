This repository contains various methods developed to control a robotic arm. Each method is implemented in its own directory and has its unique control mechanism. Here's a brief description of each:

basic_switching: Remote control switching with OLED display functionality. (遥控切换以OLED显示功能)
hardware: Implementation for ultrasonic hand gesture recognition. (单独实现超声波手势识别功能)
IRremote_test: Implementation for infrared remote control. (单独实现红外遥控控制)
joystick_control_simple: Implementation for joystick control. (单独实现摇杆控制)
oledtest: Example code for OLED. (OLED的例程)
switching_mode_test: Complete code for mode switching. (完整代码)
touchtest: Touch sensor example code. (触摸传感器例程)
ultratest: Ultrasonic distance measuring module example code. (超声波测距模块例程)
