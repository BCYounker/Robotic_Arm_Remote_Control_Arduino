# Robotic_Arm_Remote_Control_Arduino
 Code for various methods control a self-designed robotic arm.
This repository contains various methods developed to control a robotic arm. Each method is implemented in its own directory and has its unique control mechanism. Here's a brief description of each:

- basic_switching: Remote control switching with OLED display functionality.
- hardware: Implementation for ultrasonic hand gesture recognition.
- IRremote_test: Implementation for infrared remote control.
- joystick_control_simple: Implementation for joystick control.
- oledtest: Example code for OLED.
- switching_mode_test: Complete code for mode switching.
- touchtest: Touch sensor example code.
- ultratest: Ultrasonic distance measuring module example code.
